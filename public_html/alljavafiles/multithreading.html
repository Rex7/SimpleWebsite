      <h3>  Multithreading in Java</h3>
      <p>Multithreading refers to two or more tasks executing concurrently within a single program. A thread is an independent path of execution within a program. Many threads can run concurrently within a program. Every thread in Java is created and controlled by the java.lang.Thread class. A Java program can have many threads, and these threads can run concurrently, either asynchronously or synchronously.

Multithreading has several advantages over Multiprocessing such as;

Threads are lightweight compared to processes
Threads share the same address space and therefore can share both data and code
Context switching between threads is usually less expensive than between processes
Cost of thread intercommunication is relatively low that that of process intercommunication
Threads allow different tasks to be performed concurrently.</p>

<p>
<b>Multithreading</b> in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.

But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.

Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation etc.</p>

      try {
         for(int i = 4; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + threadName + ", " + i);
            Thread.sleep(50);
         }
