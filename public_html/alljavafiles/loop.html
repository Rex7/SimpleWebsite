        <h3>Java - Loop Control</h3>
        <p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages −

Loop Architecture
Java programming language provides the following types of loop to handle looping requirements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
    <h3>while loop</h3>
    <p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>    
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>for loop</h3>
                  <p>Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h3>Do...while loop</h3>
          <p>like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p>
      </li>
    <h3>  Syntax</h3>
<p>Following is the syntax of enhanced for loop −</p>
<pre>
for(declaration : expression) {
   // Statements
}
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>
<b>Declaration −</b> The newly declared block variable, is of a type compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing. The variable will be available within the for block and its value would be the same as the current array element.
</li>
<li>
<b>Expression − </b>This evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can be an array variable or method call that returns an array.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Example</h3>
<pre>
public class Test 
{

   public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers )         
        {
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print(",");
        }
      System.out.print("\n");
      String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};

      for( String name : names )
     {
         System.out.print( name );
         System.out.print(",");
     }
   }
}


<h3><b>Output</b></h3>
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
James, Larry, Tom, Lacy,
