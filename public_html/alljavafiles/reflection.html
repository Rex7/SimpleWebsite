        <h3> Reflection</h3>
        <p>In Java, the process of analysing and modifying all the capabilities of a class at runtime is called Reflection.

            Reflection API in Java is used to manipulate class and its members which include fields, methods, constructor, etc. at runtime.

            One advantage of reflection API in java is, it can manipulate private members of the class too.

            The java.lang.reflect package provides many classes to implement reflection java.Methods of the java.lang.Class class are used to gather the complete metadata of a particular class.

            Class in java.lang.reflect Package
            Following is a list of various Java classes in java.lang.package to implement reflection-
        
<b>Field:</b> This class is used to gather declarative information such as datatype, access modifier, name and value of a variable.
<b>Method:</b> This class is used to gather declarative information such as access modifier, return type, name, parameter types and exception type of a method.
<b>Constructor: </b>This class is used to gather declarative information such as access modifier, name and parameter types of a constructor.
<b>Modifier:</b> This class is used to gather information about a particular access modifier.

        Methods used in java.lang.Class
        
<b>Public String getName (): </b>Returns the name of the class.
<b>public Class getSuperclass():</b> Returns the super class reference
<b>Public Class[] getInterfaces() :</b> Returns an array of interfaces implemented by the specified class
<b>Public in getModifiers ():</b> Returns an integer value representing the modifiers of the specified class which needs to be passed as parameter to "public static String toString (int i )" method which returns the access specifier for the given class.
