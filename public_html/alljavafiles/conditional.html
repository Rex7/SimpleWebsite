        <h2>Constructors</h2>
        <p>When discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.
</p>
<p>A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that’s called when an instance of an object is created. Here are the key differences between a constructor and a method:

A constructor doesn’t have a return type.

The name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class.

Unlike methods, constructors are not considered members of a class.

A constructor is called automatically when a new instance of an object is created.</p>
 <h3><b> Example</b></h3>
<pre>
public class Puppy 
{
   public Puppy() {}
   public Puppy(String name) {
      // This constructor has one parameter, name.
   }
}

</pre>
